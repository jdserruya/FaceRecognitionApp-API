<h1>Face Recognition App</h1>

This app was developed using Reactjs, Node.js, Express.js and PostgreSQL. It allows users to login or register, and accurately detects faces in images submitted by users through a URL link through the use of an API. It also logs the entry count of images submitted for each user and displays this count to the user when signed in.

The app is hosted on Heroku along with its server and database and can be accessed from https://face-recognition-app--.herokuapp.com/.
