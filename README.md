Face Recognition App

This app was developed using Reactjs, Node.js, Express.js and PostgreSQL. It allows users to login or register, and accurately detects faces in images submitted by users through a URL link. It also assigns a rank to each user, determined by the number of URL entries they have submitted compared to other users.
